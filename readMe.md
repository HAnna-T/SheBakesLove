# She Bakes Love
  We decided to work with  real project, where  we can end up and work with customer  whims. And the common type of website is Shop.  And here we are! Our first Shop website sketch. And, don't be unnoticed , that we also had the responsibility of design. 
 ## Main page 
 ![MainPage](./Readme/mainPage.png)

As we know the First is the most important. Here we arranged the title "She bakes love" as logo, search input with bottom, four pages with links ( we used nav tag for pages ), chatbox icon, and footer. 

# Candy Shop

The tiny part of css for hover:

```
.merenga:hover .merengaText {
  visibility: visible;
}
```
